# Testing Framework for Daily Challenges

## Day 2: Turning Around - Left and Right

### **Quick Visual Tests** ‚úÖ

#### **Test 1: Basic Turn Understanding**
**Ask your son to do this:**
```
CS
FD 50
RT 90
FD 50
```
**Expected Result:** An "L" shape (line up, then line right)
**‚úÖ Pass if:** Two connected lines forming a right angle

#### **Test 2: Left Turn Test**
**Ask your son to do this:**
```
CS
FD 50
LT 90
FD 50
```
**Expected Result:** An "L" shape facing the other direction
**‚úÖ Pass if:** Two connected lines, but left-facing L

#### **Test 3: Multiple Turns**
**Ask your son to do this:**
```
CS
FD 40
RT 90
FD 40
RT 90
FD 40
```
**Expected Result:** Three connected lines forming a "U" or bracket shape
**‚úÖ Pass if:** Three lines connected at right angles

### **Understanding Check Questions** ü§î

Ask these questions and listen to responses:

1. **"What happens when you type RT 90?"**
   - ‚úÖ Good answer: "The turtle turns right" or "It changes direction"
   - ‚ùå Needs help: "It moves" or confusion about turning vs moving

2. **"If the turtle is facing up and you type RT 90, which way will it face?"**
   - ‚úÖ Good answer: "Right" or "To the side"
   - ‚ùå Needs help: Can't predict or says "forward"

3. **"Show me how to make a corner."**
   - ‚úÖ Good answer: Demonstrates FD then RT/LT then FD
   - ‚ùå Needs help: Only does one command or confused sequence

4. **"How many RT 90 turns to face the same way you started?"**
   - ‚úÖ Good answer: "Four" (bonus if they can demonstrate)
   - ‚ùå Needs help: Wrong number or doesn't understand

### **Mastery Challenges** ‚≠ê

If basic tests pass, try these challenges:

#### **Challenge A: Make a Square Corner**
"Can you make a perfect corner like the corner of a square?"
**Expected:** FD (some number), RT 90, FD (same number)

#### **Challenge B: Three Connected Lines**
"Make three lines that are all connected, each going a different direction."
**Expected:** Any combination using turns between forward movements

#### **Challenge C: Face the Opposite Direction**
"Make the turtle face the completely opposite way from where it started."
**Expected:** RT 180 or LT 180 (or two 90-degree turns)

### **Red Flags - When to Review** üö©

Stop and review Day 2 concepts if:
- Child consistently forgets to use FORWARD after turning
- Confuses left and right directions
- Expects turtle to move when it turns
- Can't predict which direction turtle will face after turning
- Gets frustrated with the turning concept

---

### **Success Indicators** üéØ

**Ready for Day 3 when child can:**
- ‚úÖ Make turtle turn left and right on command
- ‚úÖ Combine movement and turning to create corners
- ‚úÖ Predict which direction turtle will face after turning
- ‚úÖ Understand that turning changes direction without moving
- ‚úÖ Shows confidence with the turning commands

### **Quick Parent Checklist**

**Before moving to Day 3, verify:**
- [ ] Child can execute RT 90 and LT 90 commands
- [ ] Child understands turning vs moving
- [ ] Child can make connected lines with corners
- [ ] Child can predict turtle direction after turns
- [ ] Child shows enthusiasm about making shapes

**If any box is unchecked:** Spend extra time on Day 2 concepts before advancing.
