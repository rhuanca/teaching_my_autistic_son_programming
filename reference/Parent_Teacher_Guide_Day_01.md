# Day 1: First Steps - Forward and Backward

## Learning Objectives üéØ
- **Programming Concept:** Basic movement commands and sequential instructions
- **Geometric Concept:** Understanding straight lines and distance measurement
- **Skills Developed:** Following step-by-step instructions, understanding cause and effect

## Teaching Notes üìù

### Before Starting:
- Ensure FMSLogo is properly installed and working
- Show your child where the turtle (triangle) is located
- Explain that programming is giving instructions to the computer
- Emphasize that pressing ENTER is like saying "do it now!"

### If Your Child Struggles:
- **Commands don't work:** Check they're pressing ENTER after each command
- **Spacing issues:** Make sure there's a space: `FD 100` not `FD100`
- **Overwhelmed by numbers:** Start with smaller numbers like `FD 50`
- **Turtle seems stuck:** Try `CS` to clear screen and start fresh
- **Loss of interest:** Let them experiment with different numbers freely

### Signs of Success:
- Child can make the turtle move forward and backward
- They understand that numbers control how far the turtle moves
- They can predict which direction the turtle will move
- They're excited to try different numbers
- They remember to press ENTER after commands

### Extension Ideas:
- Draw lines on paper with different lengths
- Use your body: take steps forward and backward
- Compare turtle steps to real steps around the room
- Talk about robots and how they need precise instructions

### Real-World Connections:
- Remote control cars moving forward/backward
- Following directions: "take 5 steps forward"
- Robots in factories that need exact movement instructions
- GPS navigation giving distance instructions

### Common Mistakes & Solutions:
- **Mistake:** Typing `FD100` without space
  - **Solution:** Show them: "Computer needs a space to understand"
- **Mistake:** Forgetting to press ENTER
  - **Solution:** "ENTER tells the computer to do what you typed"
- **Mistake:** Expecting turtle to turn
  - **Solution:** "Today we only go straight - turning comes tomorrow!"

### Assessment Questions:
- "What happens when you type FORWARD?"
- "How do you make a longer line?"
- "What does the number after FORWARD mean?"
- "Show me how to make the turtle go backward"

### Time Management:
- **Expected time:** 15-20 minutes
- **If going too fast:** Add more experimentation with different numbers
- **If going too slow:** Focus on just `FD 100` and `BK 50`, skip extensions

### Troubleshooting Technical Issues:
- **Turtle disappears:** Type `HOME` to bring it back to center
- **Screen gets messy:** Use `CS` to clear screen
- **Commands in wrong case:** FMSLogo accepts both `FD` and `fd`
- **Window issues:** Make sure command input area (bottom) is clicked

### Preparation for Day 2:
- "Tomorrow we'll learn how to make the turtle turn corners!"
- "Think about how you turn when you're walking"
- Save any interesting patterns they created today
