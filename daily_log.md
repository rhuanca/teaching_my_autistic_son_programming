### Programming Work Completed
- ✅ Fixed Day 3 evaluator canvas errors and implemented proper evaluation logic
- ✅ Added simulation fallback for turtle graphics reliability  
- ✅ Implemented Day 4 evaluation (pen control - PENUP/PENDOWN)
- ✅ Implemented Day 6 evaluation (triangles - RT 120 turns)
- ✅ Implemented Day 7 evaluation (colors - PENCOLOR commands)
- ✅ All evaluator tests working for Days 1-7
- ✅ Reduced daily challenges from 2+2 to 1 Easy + 1 Hard across all guides (Days 1-7)
- ✅ Removed "My favorite pattern" and "My coolest pattern" reflection prompts for cleaner worksheets
- ✅ Made curriculum more autism-friendly with clear completion criteria
- ✅ Fixed Day 6 evaluator to properly recognize advanced student work combining triangles and squares
- ✅ Updated Day 6 evaluation logic to reward students who go beyond basic requirements
- ✅ Fixed turtle graphics window closing issues - added click-to-close and clear instructions
- ✅ **Started Phase 2 Basics** - Introduced REPEAT loops for programming structures
- ✅ Created Day 8 guide - First REPEAT loops (squares, triangles, hexagons)
- ✅ Added REPEAT command parsing support to evaluator with bracket handling
- ✅ Implemented Day 8 evaluation logic testing REPEAT usage and efficiency
- ✅ Moved Day 8 to phase2_basic folder structure
- ✅ Started developing Day 9 guide for REPEAT patterns

### Issues Encountered
- Canvas errors in turtle graphics requiring simulation fallback
- Double popup windows in console mode (resolved)
- Complex embedded graphics causing user experience issues (reverted to simpler approach)
- Day 6 evaluator too strict - failed excellent student code that combined triangles and squares (fixed)
- Turtle graphics windows couldn't be closed properly (fixed with click-to-close)

### Lessons Learned
- Made some requests to improve the evaluator. In GUI and console mode. They were good.

### Notes for Tomorrow
- Continue Phase 2 with Days 9-10 (REPEAT patterns and complex shapes)
- Test son's readiness for Day 8 REPEAT concepts

### Son's Progress
- ✅ **Ready for Phase 2!** Created loop statement curriculum (REPEAT commands)
- Day 8 introduces programming structures - major milestone from basic commands to loops
- REPEAT will make his code much more efficient and enable complex patterns
