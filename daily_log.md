### Programming Work Completed
- ✅ Fixed Day 3 evaluator canvas errors and implemented proper evaluation logic
- ✅ Added simulation fallback for turtle graphics reliability  
- ✅ Implemented Day 4 evaluation (pen control - PENUP/PENDOWN)
- ✅ Implemented Day 6 evaluation (triangles - RT 120 turns)
- ✅ Implemented Day 7 evaluation (colors - PENCOLOR commands)
- ✅ All evaluator tests working for Days 1-7
- ✅ Reduced daily challenges from 2+2 to 1 Easy + 1 Hard across all guides (Days 1-7)
- ✅ Removed "My favorite pattern" and "My coolest pattern" reflection prompts for cleaner worksheets
- ✅ Made curriculum more autism-friendly with clear completion criteria

### Issues Encountered
- Canvas errors in turtle graphics requiring simulation fallback
- Double popup windows in console mode (resolved)
- Complex embedded graphics causing user experience issues (reverted to simpler approach)

### Lessons Learned
- Made some requests to improve the evaluator. In GUI and console mode. They were good.

### Notes for Tomorrow
- Consider introducing loop statements if son is ready

### Son's Progress
- I'm thinking that my son can start to work on loop statements. But I'll see what happens tomorrow.

### Ideas for Future
