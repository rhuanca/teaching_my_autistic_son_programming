# Teaching My Autistic Son Programming

A comprehensive turtle graphics programming curriculum designed to teach fundamental programming concepts through visual, interactive learning using FMSLogo.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project provides a structured, daily challenge-based approach to teaching programming concepts to children through turtle graphics. The visual, immediate feedback nature of turtle graphics makes abstract programming concepts concrete and engaging, while geometric patterns provide a natural bridge between mathematics and computer science.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Learn fundamental programming structures** through visual, interactive coding
- **Develop geometric understanding** by creating shapes, patterns, and mathematical designs
- **Build problem-solving skills** through daily progressive challenges
- **Foster creativity** by combining programming logic with artistic expression

### Educational Approach
- **Visual Learning** - Immediate graphical feedback for every command
- **Progressive Difficulty** - Each day builds naturally on previous concepts
- **Structured Challenges** - Daily 15-30 minute focused lessons
- **Creative Expression** - Encourages artistic exploration within programming

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- **FMSLogo installed** (see installation guide in `docs/`)
- **Python 3.9+** (for evaluation tool)
- **conda** (recommended for environment management)

### Setup for Daily Challenges
1. **Install FMSLogo** following `docs/FMSLogo_Installation_Guide_Simple.md`
2. **Print daily challenges** from `daily_challenges/phase1_elemental/`
3. **Review parent guide** in `reference/Complete_Parent_Teacher_Guide_Week1.md`
4. **Start with Day 1!**

### Setup for Code Evaluation Tool
1. **Create conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n turtle_eval python=3.9
   conda activate turtle_eval
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Install via conda (preferred for these packages)
   conda install matplotlib tk
   
   # Install remaining via pip
   pip install turtle
   ```

3. **Run the evaluator:**
   ```bash
   python tools/fmslogo_evaluator.py
   ```

4. **When finished:**
   ```bash
   conda deactivate
   ```
