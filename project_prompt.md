# Project Prompt: Autism-Friendly Programming Curriculum

## Objective
Create a structured and autism-friendly programming curriculum for children, using turtle graphics (e.g., FMSLogo) as the primary tool. The curriculum should be engaging, visual, and progressive, focusing on building foundational programming skills.

## Requirements

### 1. Curriculum Design
- Divide the curriculum into phases (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced).
- Each phase should have daily challenges that focus on specific programming concepts.
- Challenges should include both easy and hard tasks to cater to different skill levels.

### 2. Daily Challenges
- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for each challenge.
- Include hints to encourage problem-solving without giving away the solution.
- Focus on concepts like loops, variables, conditional logic, and geometric patterns.

### 3. Guides and Documentation
- Create kid-friendly guides with examples and visuals.
- Include a "Remember" section in each guide to reinforce prior knowledge.
- Provide a parent/teacher guide with tips for supporting the child.

### 4. Project Structure
- Organize the curriculum into folders for each phase and day.
- Include a `README.md` file summarizing the project structure and goals.
- Add a progress tracker to monitor the child's learning journey.

### 5. Learning Philosophy
- Emphasize visual learning with immediate feedback from turtle graphics.
- Use structured routines and clear objectives to make the curriculum autism-friendly.
- Encourage creativity and exploration within the challenges.

### 6. Tools and Resources
- Provide installation guides for the required software (e.g., FMSLogo).
- Include a Python-based evaluation tool to assess the child's code.
- Offer quick reference cards for commands and troubleshooting tips.

### 7. Future Scalability
- Design the curriculum to be adaptable for other programming tools or languages.
- Include prompts for creating new courses based on the same structure.

### 8. Example Deliverables
- A project folder structure with guides, challenges, and resources.
- Example daily challenges for beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels.
- A progress tracker template for monitoring learning.

## Goal
Make programming accessible, engaging, and fun for children while building foundational skills for future learning. The curriculum should foster creativity, problem-solving, and confidence in programming.
