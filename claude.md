| 2 | Turning Around | RIGHT, LEFT | Direction control, combining commands |
| 3 | All Directions | HOME, radial patterns | Creating patterns from center point |
| 4 | Pen Control | PENUP, PENDOWN | State control, positioning without drawing |
| 5 | Making a Square | Shape creation | Combining all learned commands |
| 6 | Triangle Time | Different angles | Understanding shape-specific requirements |
| 7 | Colors and Fun | PENCOLOR | Visual enhancement, creative expression |

## Technical Implementation

### Environment Setup
- **Platform**: FMSLogo for student programming
- **Evaluation**: Python with conda environment
- **Dependencies**: turtle, matplotlib, tkinter
- **Workflow**: conda environment isolation for clean dependency management

### Evaluation System
- **Automated Testing**: Python tool evaluates code against day-specific requirements
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows turtle graphics execution
- **Detailed Analysis**: Tracks position, direction, pen state, command usage
- **Encouraging Feedback**: Provides specific improvement suggestions

### Communication Workflow
1. **Student completes daily challenge** in FMSLogo
2. **Sends code via email** (text format preferred, screenshots require OCR)
3. **Parent evaluates using conda tool**:
   ```bash
   conda activate turtle_eval
   python tools/fmslogo_evaluator.py
   ```
4. **Parent provides feedback** based on automated results

## Current Status

### Completed
