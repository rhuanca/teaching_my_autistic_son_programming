**Date:** ___________

## Today's Mission üöÄ
Learn to make the turtle turn left and right!

## Let's Start! 

### Step 1: Review Yesterday
- [ ] Open FMSLogo and type `CS`
- [ ] Type `FD 100` - remember this?
- [ ] Watch the turtle draw a line going up

### Step 2: First Turn
- [ ] Type `RT 90` and press ENTER
- [ ] Notice the turtle turned but didn't move!
- [ ] Now type `FD 100` and press ENTER
- [ ] Cool! The line goes right now! ‚û°Ô∏è

### Step 3: Try Left Turns
- [ ] Type `CS` to start fresh
- [ ] Try this: `FD 50`, then `LT 90`, then `FD 50`
- [ ] What shape did you make?

## Challenge Time! ‚≠ê

### Easy:
- Make a "staircase": `FD 30`, `RT 90`, `FD 30`, `LT 90`, `FD 30`

### Hard:
- Can you make the turtle face straight down? (Hint: try `RT 180`)

## Think About It ü§î
1. What happens when you type RIGHT or LEFT?
2. How many right turns to face the same way again?
3. Where do you see corners like this around you?
