**Date:** ___________

## Today's Mission 🚀
Make lines going in all different directions from the center!

### New Command:
- `HOME` - Brings turtle back to center facing up

---

## Let's Start! 

### Step 1: Four Direction Challenge
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear screen
- [ ] Draw UP: `FD 50`
- [ ] Type `HOME` to return to center
- [ ] Draw RIGHT: `RT 90` then `FD 50`
- [ ] Type `HOME` again
- [ ] Draw DOWN: `RT 180` then `FD 50`
- [ ] Type `HOME` again
- [ ] Draw LEFT: `LT 90` then `FD 50`

### Step 2: Star Pattern
- [ ] Type `CS` to start fresh
- [ ] Try this pattern:
  - `FD 80`
  - `HOME`
  - `RT 45`
  - `FD 80`
  - `HOME`
  - `RT 90`
  - `FD 80`
  - `HOME`

## Challenge Time! ⭐

### Easy:
- Make longer lines: use `FD 100` instead of `FD 50`
- Try diagonal lines: `RT 45`, `FD 70`, `HOME`

### Hard:
- Can you make exactly 6 lines equally spaced?
- Create your own "fireworks" pattern!

## Think About It 🤔
1. Why do we use HOME between each line?
2. What happens if you don't use HOME?
3. What patterns in nature look like this?
