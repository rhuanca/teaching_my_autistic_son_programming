# Day 6: Triangle Time

**Date:** ___________

## Today's Mission 🚀
Learn to draw triangles - they need different turns than squares! 🔺

### Important:
- Triangles have 3 sides
- Each corner needs `RT 120` (not 90 like squares!)

---

## Let's Start! 

### Step 1: Think About Triangles
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear screen
- [ ] Remember: squares use `RT 90`
- [ ] Triangles are different - they use `RT 120`

### Step 2: Draw Your First Triangle
- [ ] First side: `FD 100`
- [ ] Turn corner: `RT 120`
- [ ] Second side: `FD 100`
- [ ] Turn corner: `RT 120`
- [ ] Third side: `FD 100`
- [ ] Final turn: `RT 120`
- [ ] Triangle complete! 🎉

### Step 3: Different Triangle Sizes
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear
- [ ] Small triangle: `FD 60` and `RT 120`
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear
- [ ] Large triangle: `FD 140` and `RT 120`

### Step 4: Compare Shapes
- [ ] Type `CS`
- [ ] Draw a square: `FD 80`, `RT 90` (repeat 4 times)
- [ ] Move away: `PU`, `FD 150`, `PD`
- [ ] Draw a triangle: `FD 80`, `RT 120` (repeat 3 times)

## Challenge Time! ⭐

### Easy:
- Draw triangles in different sizes

### Hard:
- Make a triangle next to a square

---

## Think About It 🤔
1. How many sides does a triangle have?
2. Why do triangles use 120° instead of 90°?
3. What things around you are triangle-shaped?
