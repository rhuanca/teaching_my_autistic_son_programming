# Day 5: Making a Square

**Date:** ___________

## Today's Mission 🚀
Create your first complete shape - a perfect square! 🟩

### Remember These Commands:
- `FD 100` - forward
- `RT 90` - turn right (90 degrees = square corner!)

---

## Let's Start! 

### Step 1: Plan Your Square
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear screen
- [ ] Think: squares have 4 equal sides and 4 corners
- [ ] Each corner is a 90-degree right turn

### Step 2: Draw Your First Square
- [ ] First side: `FD 100`
- [ ] Turn corner: `RT 90`
- [ ] Second side: `FD 100`
- [ ] Turn corner: `RT 90`
- [ ] Third side: `FD 100`
- [ ] Turn corner: `RT 90`
- [ ] Fourth side: `FD 100`
- [ ] Final turn: `RT 90`
- [ ] Perfect square! 🎉

### Step 3: Different Size Squares
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear
- [ ] Make a small square using `FD 50` for each side
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear
- [ ] Make a big square using `FD 150` for each side

## Challenge Time! ⭐

### Easy:
- Make three squares: small (50), medium (100), large (150)
- Try making a square with `FD 25` - super tiny!

### Hard:
- Draw two squares that don't touch (use pen up/down)
- Make a square inside another square

## Think About It 🤔
1. How many sides does a square have?
2. Why do we turn right 90 degrees at each corner?
3. Where do you see squares around you?
