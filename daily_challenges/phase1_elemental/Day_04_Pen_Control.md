# Day 4: Pen Up, Pen Down - Control

**Date:** ___________

## Today's Mission üöÄ
Learn to control when the turtle draws and when it just moves!

### New Commands:
- `PENUP` (or `PU`) - Lift pen (move without drawing)
- `PENDOWN` (or `PD`) - Put pen down (draw when moving)

---

## Let's Start! 

### Step 1: Understanding Pen Control
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear screen
- [ ] Type `FD 50` - see the line drawn
- [ ] Type `PU` (pen up) and press ENTER
- [ ] Type `FD 50` - turtle moves but no line! ‚ú®
- [ ] Type `PD` (pen down) and press ENTER
- [ ] Type `FD 50` - drawing again!

### Step 2: Make a Dashed Line
- [ ] Type `CS` to start fresh
- [ ] Try this:
  - `FD 30` (draws line)
  - `PU` (pen up)
  - `FD 20` (moves without drawing)
  - `PD` (pen down)
  - `FD 30` (draws line again)

### Step 3: Separate Shapes
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear
- [ ] Draw first line: `FD 60`
- [ ] Move to new spot: `PU`, `RT 90`, `FD 100`, `LT 90`
- [ ] Draw second line: `PD`, `FD 60`
- [ ] You have two separate lines!

## Challenge Time! ‚≠ê

### Easy:
- Make three separate small lines in different places
- Create a pattern: draw, skip, draw, skip, draw

### Hard:
- Draw the letter "H" using pen up/down
- Make two squares that don't touch each other

## Think About It ü§î
1. When should you use pen up vs pen down?
2. How is this like writing with a real pen?
3. What letter shapes need pen up/down to draw?
