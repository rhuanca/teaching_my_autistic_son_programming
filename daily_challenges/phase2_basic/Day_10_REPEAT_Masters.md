# Day 10: REPEAT Masters - Complex Patterns! üé®

**Date:** ___________

## Today's Mission üöÄ
Combine REPEAT commands to create amazing complex patterns - you're becoming a REPEAT expert!

### What You Know:
- `REPEAT number [commands]` - Basic loops
- Stars, shapes, and simple patterns
- How to turn between patterns

---

## Let's Start! 

### Step 1: Flower Power üå∏
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear screen
- [ ] Make a flower with 8 petals:
- [ ] `REPEAT 8 [REPEAT 3 [FD 60 RT 120] RT 45]`
- [ ] WOW! REPEAT inside REPEAT!

### Step 2: Understanding Nested REPEAT
- [ ] **Outside REPEAT**: `REPEAT 8` - Makes 8 petals
- [ ] **Inside REPEAT**: `REPEAT 3 [FD 60 RT 120]` - Makes each petal (triangle)
- [ ] **Between petals**: `RT 45` - Turns to next petal position

### Step 3: Square Flower
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear
- [ ] Try: `REPEAT 6 [REPEAT 4 [FD 50 RT 90] RT 60]`
- [ ] A flower made of squares!

### Step 4: Spiral Patterns
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear
- [ ] Growing spiral: `REPEAT 50 [FD 100 RT 91]`
- [ ] Almost a circle, but spirals outward!

## Challenge Time! ‚≠ê

### Easy:
- Make a triangle flower: `REPEAT 12 [REPEAT 3 [FD 40 RT 120] RT 30]`

### Hard:
- Create your own pattern using REPEAT inside REPEAT!

## Advanced REPEAT Tricks üéØ

### Rainbow Spokes
- [ ] Type `CS`
- [ ] `REPEAT 18 [FD 150 BK 150 RT 20]`
- [ ] Perfect sun rays!

### Growing Squares
- [ ] Type `CS`
- [ ] `REPEAT 10 [REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT 90] RT 36]`
- [ ] Squares that rotate around!

### Dotted Circle
- [ ] Type `CS`
- [ ] `REPEAT 36 [FD 5 PU FD 5 PD RT 10]`
- [ ] A circle made of dots!

## Pro Tips üí°
- **Start simple** - Get one REPEAT working, then add another
- **Small numbers first** - Try `REPEAT 4` before `REPEAT 20`
- **Experiment with angles** - Small changes = big differences!
- **Save your favorites** - Write down patterns you love!

---

## Think About It ü§î
1. What happens when you put REPEAT inside REPEAT?
2. How do the two numbers work together?
3. What's the most complex pattern you can imagine?

## üéØ Advanced Pattern Quick Reference:
- **Flower pattern**: `REPEAT outer [REPEAT inner [shape] RT turn]`
- **Spiral**: `REPEAT many [FD distance RT almost90]`
- **Sun rays**: `REPEAT spokes [FD length BK length RT angle]`
- **Rotating shapes**: `REPEAT count [make_shape RT rotation]`
- **Dotted lines**: Use `PU` and `PD` inside REPEAT
