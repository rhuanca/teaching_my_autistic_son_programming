# Day 9: REPEAT Patterns - Stars and Spikes! ‚≠ê

**Date:** ___________

## Today's Mission üöÄ
Create amazing star patterns using REPEAT - now you know the power, let's make cool designs!

### Review from Day 8:
- `REPEAT number [commands]` - Repeat commands inside brackets
- Brackets [ ] are REQUIRED for REPEAT to work

---

## Let's Start! 

### Step 1: Make a Simple Star ‚≠ê
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear screen
- [ ] Type: `REPEAT 5 [FD 100 RT 144]`
- [ ] Press ENTER
- [ ] Cool! A 5-pointed star! ‚ú®

### Step 2: Understanding the Star
- [ ] **5 points** = `REPEAT 5`
- [ ] **144 degrees** = special angle for 5-point stars
- [ ] Try different sizes: `REPEAT 5 [FD 80 RT 144]`

### Step 3: Different Stars
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear
- [ ] 8-pointed star: `REPEAT 8 [FD 80 RT 135]`
- [ ] WOW! Different number of points!

### Step 4: Star Patterns
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear
- [ ] Make a pattern of stars:
- [ ] `REPEAT 5 [FD 100 RT 144]` (first star)
- [ ] `RT 72` (turn between stars)
- [ ] `REPEAT 5 [FD 100 RT 144]` (second star)
- [ ] Amazing star flower! üåü

## Challenge Time! ‚≠ê

### Easy:
- Make a 6-pointed star: `REPEAT 6 [FD 70 RT 120]`

### Hard:
- Make 3 different stars in a row - try different sizes and points!

## Cool REPEAT Ideas üí°

### Spiky Circles
- [ ] Type `CS` 
- [ ] Try: `REPEAT 36 [FD 20 BK 20 RT 10]`
- [ ] A spiky sun pattern!

### Square Spiral
- [ ] Type `CS`
- [ ] Try: `REPEAT 20 [FD 100 RT 89]`
- [ ] Almost like a square, but cooler!

## Think About It ü§î
1. Why do different numbers make different star shapes?
2. What happens if you change the angle in a star?
3. How could you make a star pattern that fills the screen?

## üéØ Star Pattern Quick Reference:
- **5-point star**: `REPEAT 5 [FD size RT 144]`

- **8-point star**: `REPEAT 8 [FD size RT 135]`
- **Spiky sun**: `REPEAT 36 [FD 20 BK 20 RT 10]`
- **Turn between patterns**: Use `RT angle` or `LT angle`
