# Day 14: Variables for Dynamic Spirals

**Date:** ___________

## Today's Mission ðŸš€
Learn how to use variables to create dynamic spirals that change as the program runs!

### Remember ðŸŒŸ
- **What are variables?**
  - Variables are like containers that store values you can use and change in your program.
  - Use the `MAKE` command to create a variable.
    Example:
    ```
    MAKE "steps 10
    FD :steps
    ```
    - This creates a variable `steps` with a value of `10`.
    - The `FD :steps` command moves the turtle forward by the value stored in `steps`.

- **Why use variables?**
  - Variables make your code flexible and reusable.
  - You can change the value of a variable to create dynamic effects.

### Step 1: Create a Dynamic Spiral
- Open FMSLogo and type `CS` to clear the screen.
- Think about how you can use variables to control the step size and angle of the spiral.
- Try to write a program that:
  - Starts with a small step size.
  - Increases the step size with each iteration.
  - Uses a fixed angle to create the spiral.

- Hint:
  - Use the `MAKE` command to create variables for the step size and angle.
  - Update the step size variable inside the loop.

- Test your program and observe how the spiral changes!

Happy coding! ðŸŽ¨
