# Day 8: First REPEAT - The Power Loop! 

**Date:** ___________

## Today's Mission üöÄ
Learn to use REPEAT to make the turtle do things over and over - much faster than typing everything!

### New Command:
- `REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT 90]` - Do the commands inside [ ] brackets 4 times
- **Important**: Always use square brackets [ ] with REPEAT

---

## Let's Start! 

### Step 1: Remember the Old Way
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear screen
- [ ] Make a square the old way (takes 8 commands!):
  - `FD 80`
  - `RT 90`
  - `FD 80`
  - `RT 90`
  - `FD 80`
  - `RT 90`
  - `FD 80`
  - `RT 90`

### Step 2: The Amazing New Way! ‚ú®
- [ ] Type `CS` to start fresh
- [ ] Type this magic command: `REPEAT 4 [FD 80 RT 90]`
- [ ] Press ENTER and watch!
- [ ] WOW! Same square with just ONE command! üéâ

### Step 3: Understanding REPEAT
- [ ] `REPEAT 4` means "do this 4 times"
- [ ] `[FD 80 RT 90]` means "the commands to repeat"
- [ ] Square brackets [ ] are VERY important!

### Step 4: Try a Triangle
- [ ] Type `CS` to clear
- [ ] Old way would need 6 commands... 
- [ ] New way: `REPEAT 3 [FD 100 RT 120]`
- [ ] Perfect triangle in one line! üî∫

## Challenge Time! ‚≠ê

### Easy:
- Make a triangle with sides of 60: `REPEAT 3 [FD 60 RT 120]`

### Hard:
- Make a hexagon (6 sides): `REPEAT 6 [FD 50 RT 60]`

## Think About It ü§î
1. How many commands did you save by using REPEAT?
2. What other shapes could you make with REPEAT?
3. Why do you think brackets [ ] are important?
